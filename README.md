# Resume

This is a resume project for Saffat Hasan.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to begin decoupling my resume format from the data I am providing.

## Layout

- `data`: contains original. imported from [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com). You can simply add the two files there and it 'just works'.
- `templates`: to contain the template to be rendered
- `resources` to contain the split up data entries (e.g. experience, education, etc)
- `src`: to contain any rendering code
- `Makefile`: ultimately want some `make run` target to generate a PDF with resume
